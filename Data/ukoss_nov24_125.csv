During stay:Ventilated for 1 day. Intubated at delivery (13 min), given Curosurf (14 min) and started on PC-AC VG 5mL/kg, FiO2 1.0 ventilation. Ventilation
was very quickly changed to conventional PC-AC using increasing pressures up to 36/6. Significant concerns regarding oxygenation (sats
65%) despite FiO2 1.0. In total 5 Curosurf doses were given (total 1.2g). With each administration sats improved transiently, peak saturations obtain 94%, before once again decreasing.
First gas demonstrated a significant mixed acidosis, with a pH 6.5, pCO2 24, lactate 18.
A right pneumothorax was identified on CXR at 2 hours of age. Chest drain inserted. Air aspirated.
